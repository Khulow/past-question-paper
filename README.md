Past Question Paper Mobile Application

• Problem Statement

Many South African matric students struggle to find effective ways to prepare for their 
final exams, often lacking access to structured revision materials. Traditional study 
methods can be overwhelming, and students may find it difficult to track their progress. 
To address this challenge, this app provides a digital platform where matric students 
can practice multiple-choice quizzes based on past exam papers. By offering subject specific quizzes categorized by year, exam type, and topic, the app helps students 
reinforce their knowledge, improve their exam readiness, and gain confidence in their 
studies.

• Solution

The app curates and organizes past matric exam questions (e.g., from 2022, 2023) in 
multiple-choice format for various subjects.
Students can easily browse by subject (Mathematics, Physical Sciences, Life Sciences, 
etc.) and topic to focus on the areas they need most. 
Structured Practice and Feedback.
Multiple-choice quizzes simulate real exam conditions, helping students become 
familiar with question styles and time constraints.
Instant feedback on answers allows students to learn from mistakes right away, 
reinforcing correct concepts.

Progress Tracking and Performance Insights

A personalized dashboard displays metrics such as accuracy percentage, overall 
progress, and areas needing improvement.
Students can monitor their growth over time, stay motivated, and identify weaker 
subjects/topics for targeted revision.

User-Friendly Interface

A clean, intuitive design makes it simple to navigate between subjects, topics, and 
quizzes.
Quick access to past questions, explanations, and progress insights streamlines the 
study process and keeps students focused.

Flexible, Anytime-Anywhere Access

Being mobile-friendly, the app supports on-the-go learning, allowing students to 
practice whenever and wherever they have time.
